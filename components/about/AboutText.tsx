I'm a programmer with over 3 years of experience, I’m a versatile Web Developer skilled in designing, developing, and managing websites, with a particular focus on PHP and JavaScript. As a self-taught developer, I’m passionate about creating engaging and interactive websites. I’m not just a coder, but also a problem solver, and a lifelong learner—constantly eager to explore new things. Taking an unconventional route, I chose hands-on learning and real-world applications which has helped me build resilience and adaptability in my approach. Currently, I work as a Web Developer at a company in Surakarta (Solo). I’m always open to new opportunities and collaborations, so feel free to reach out to me! 🚀`;
